    <p>You get in your car, turn the key, and then…nothing. If you’ve been there before
        (and chances are high that you have) you know exactly what happens next. Your stomach
        sinks and you frantically turn the key again. Instead of sitting in your driveway,
        apartment lot, or work parking garage in denial, jump into action and find a solution.
        </p>
    <p>A car battery is the most crucial piece of equipment to starting and driving your vehicle.
        It sends power from the starter motor to the sparks plugs, igniting your car’s fuel,
        while also giving other systems power. This includes lights, radio, air conditioning,
        and more. You may be able to tell when your car battery starts to die if you find it
        difficult to start, have flickering lights, or a weakening alarm system</p>

    <h4>How to jump start a car</h4>

   width="350" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h5>1) Find the battery</h5>
        <p>
            In most cars, the battery sits in the engine compartment under the hood. However, it
            may also be located in the trunk or under the rear seat. If you can’t find the battery,
            check your owner’s manual. Can’t find your owner’s manual? Not to worry. Even when a car
            battery is hidden in a hard-to-find spot, it’s often wired to the engine compartment to
            support jump-starting conveniently from under the hood.While it’s extremely rare, batteries
            can rupture and leak acid, and connecting jumper cables incorrectly can create sparks. For
            this reason, eye and hand protection is recommended. In the case of a battery that’s been
            dead for a long time, it’s best to seek professional assistance due to the added risk of complications.
        </p>

        <h5>2) Get the jumper cables</h5>
        <p>
            To jump-start a dead battery from another vehicle, first make sure the car providing
            the jump is turned off, and then begin connecting the jumper cables to the car receiving
            the jump. Identify the positive terminal or connection point under the hood (usually noted
            by a red cover and a “+” symbol). The surest way to know you have found the positive terminal
            is to look for the “+” embossed on the actual battery. Clip one of the positive red clamps to
            the positive terminal.Next, connect the other red clamp to the positive terminal of
            the car providing the jump, followed by the negative black clamp to the negative
            terminal of the car providing the jump. Finally, to ensure a grounded connection and
            avoid damaging the battery, attach the final negative clamp (located next to the
            positive clamp) to a sizable metallic component of the engine—NOT the negative
            terminal of the battery. Don't clamp to thin sheet metal, painted surfaces, or
            fluid-bearing tubes. Also be careful to avoid areas around the belts of the engine and the cooling fans.
        </p>
        <h5>3) Start the car</h5>
        <p>
            Start the engine of the car providing the jump and, after letting it run for a few minutes,
            attempt to start the car with the dead battery. The car may crank slowly, but the goal is to
            get the engine to start. If the engine does not start, turn off both cars, check all your
            connections, adjusting the clamps as needed to ensure full contact, and restart the engine
            of the car providing the jump, followed by the car with the dead battery. If the car
            still does not start, leave the cables connected and let the running vehicle “charge” the dead battery
            for 10 to 15 minutes before trying to start the dead car again. Once the car with the
            dead battery is running, carefully disconnect each connection, starting with the grounded
            negative clamp on the car that provided the jump first. From there, disconnect the negative
            clamp from the car that received the jump, followed by the positive cables in whichever sequence
            is most convenient. Be careful to keep the jump leads and clamps away from rotating components
            of the now running engine. Also, it’s a good idea to keep the newly re-charged battery in use
            for 30 minutes before turning off the engine in order to ensure the charge holds. If the battery
            is nearing the end of its life (usually around 6 years), it may need to be replaced by a mechanic.
