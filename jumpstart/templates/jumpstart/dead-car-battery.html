    <h4 align="center">Reasons for a dead car battery</h4>
    <h5>Human error</h5>
    <p>You’ve probably done this at least once in your life – you come home from work, tired and not
        really thinking, and left the headlights on, didn't completely close the trunk, or even forgot
        about some internal lights. Overnight the battery drains, and in the morning your car won’t
        start. Many new cars alert you if you’ve left your lights on, but may not have alerts for other components.</p>

    <h5>Faulty Charging</h5>
    <p>If your charging system isn’t working properly, your car battery can drain even while you’re
        driving. Many cars power their lights, radio, and other systems from the alternator, which
        can make the battery drain worse if there's a charging problem. The alternator may have loose
        belts or worn-out tensioners that keep it from working properly.</p>

<h5>Defective Alternator</h5>
    <p>A car alternator recharges the battery and powers certain electrical systems like lights,
        radio, air-conditioning, and automatic windows. If your alternator has a bad diode, your
        battery can drain. The bad alternator diode can cause the circuit to charge even when the
        engine is shut off, and you end up in the morning with a car that won’t start because of the dead battery.</p>

        <h4 align="center">How to change your car battery</h4>
        <p>
            Just like any battery, car batteries eventually die. Fortunately, replacing a car battery
            isn't that difficult and as long as you didn't get stranded somewhere, the hardest part
            about this DIY skill is lifting out the old battery and putting in the new one. As for
            tools, you also don't need anything special for this task—just a socket wrench set or a
            combination wrench, a pair of gloves, and maybe a wire brush. Once you're ready to install
            the new car battery, shut off the car's engine, pop the hood, and locate your battery.
        </p>
        <h5>1) Detach battery cables</h5>
        <p>
            Starting with the negative (black) battery cable, loosen the nut holding it in place.
            You can use a combination wrench or the correct size socket with extension and ratchet
            to remove it. Once loosened, detach the negative cable by pulling it up and off. Next,
            do the same steps with the positive (red) battery cable.
        </p>
        <h5>2) Remove battery hold down clamp</h5>
        <p>
            Using your combination wrench, you can now remove the battery hold down clamp or other
            battery restraints your vehicle may have that are holding the battery in place.
        </p>
        <h5>3) Remove the battery</h5>
        <p>
            To remove the car's battery, use both hands to grab the battery from the battery
            tray as it will be heavy at around 40 pounds. If the battery has a handle, you can use that instead.
        </p>
        <h5>4) Remove corrosion</h5>
        <p>
            Before you replace the old car battery with a new one, you should clean up any corrosion
            that was left behind. This corrosion is usually seen as a cakey white residue, which is
            residue from the battery that may have built up around your battery's terminals. You can use a
            battery cleaning solution for heavy corrosion, or a mix of baking soda and water to make it
            into a paste. Use an old toothbrush or wire brush when cleaning the terminals and a rag on
            any other areas. Remember to clean the hold down clamp as well. Wipe down everything with a
            dry cloth when done.
        </p>
        <h5>5) Install new battery</h5>
        <p>
            Put the new battery into the battery tray and secure it in place again with the battery hold
            down clamp. If you have any anti-corrosion battery terminal spray, use it now on both
            terminal ends. Make sure that the positive and negative terminals are on the right side.
        </p>
        <h5>6) Reattach battery cables</h5>
        <p>
            Reattach the battery cables. This time you will start with the positive (red) first. Attach and
            secure the positive cable and then do the same with the negative (black) battery cable. Doing it in
            this order is important so that you do not have any electrical issues.
        </p>
